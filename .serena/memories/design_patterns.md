# Design Patterns and Guidelines

## Ableton Live Framework Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- Each major feature is implemented as a separate Component class
- Components inherit from `_Framework` base classes (e.g., `ControlSurfaceComponent`)
- Use composition over inheritance where possible
- Clear separation between UI elements and business logic

### Event-Driven Programming
- Heavy use of the SlotManager pattern for event handling
- Register callbacks using `register_slot()` method
- Clean up slots properly in `disconnect()` methods
- Use subject/observer pattern for parameter changes

### MIDI Message Handling
- Custom element classes extend framework's ButtonElement and SliderElement
- Implement proper MIDI message routing
- Handle different MIDI message types (CC, notes, SysEx)
- Support for different Launchpad models with varying MIDI implementations

## Code Organization Patterns

### Settings-Driven Configuration
- Central `Settings.py` class with boolean flags and tunable parameters
- Feature flags for experimental functionality
- Runtime configuration without code changes
- Clear documentation of each setting's purpose

### Model-Specific Implementations
- Separate skin/color files for different hardware models
- Conditional logic based on device capabilities
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Unified interface despite hardware differences

### Layered Component System
- Main selector components manage mode switching
- Sub-components handle specific functionality
- Proxy pattern for component communication
- Clean component lifecycle management

## Development Guidelines

### Compatibility Considerations
- Maintain Python 2/3 compatibility for older Ableton versions
- Use `__future__` imports for compatibility features
- Graceful handling of missing optional dependencies
- Consider different Ableton Live versions and their Framework changes

### Error Handling Philosophy
- Fail gracefully when hardware is disconnected
- Provide fallback behavior for unsupported operations
- Log errors for debugging but don't crash the host application
- Validate user inputs and hardware states

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize CPU usage in real-time MIDI callbacks
- Cache expensive computations when possible
- Efficient color/LED update strategies
- Avoid blocking operations in main thread

### Extensibility Patterns
- Plugin-like architecture for new modes
- Configuration-driven feature enabling
- Clear interfaces between components
- Modular design allowing feature additions without core changes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't modify Ableton's `_Framework` modules directly
- Avoid tight coupling between unrelated components  
- Don't assume specific hardware capabilities
- Avoid hardcoded magic numbers (use constants)
- Don't ignore resource cleanup in disconnect methods

## Testing Philosophy
- Manual testing with actual hardware is essential
- Test across multiple Launchpad models when possible
- Verify functionality doesn't interfere with Ableton Live's core features
- Consider edge cases like device disconnection during use
